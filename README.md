## first program invert values

Given a set of numbers, return the additive inverse of each. Each positive becomes negatives, and the negatives become positives.

invert([1,2,3,4,5]) == [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]
invert([1,-2,3,-4,5]) == [-1,2,-3,4,-5]
invert([]) == []
You can assume that all values are integers. Do not mutate the input array/list.

## second program highestlowest

The highest/lowest element is respectively only one element at each edge, even if there are more than one with the same value!)

Example:

{ 6, 2, 1, 8, 10 } => 16
{ 1, 1, 11, 2, 3 } => 6

If array is empty, null or None, or if only 1 Element exists, return 0.
Note:In C++ instead null an empty vector is used. In C there is no null. ;-) 


-- There's no null in Haskell, therefore Maybe [Int] is used. Nothing represents null.
Have fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-)

I have created other katas. Have a look if you like coding and challenges.

## third program string to number

Note: This kata is inspired by Convert a Number to a String!. Try that one too.

Description

We need a function that can transform a string into a number. What ways of achieving this do you know?

Note: Don't worry, all inputs will be strings, and every string is a perfectly valid representation of an integral number.

Examples

stringToNumber("1234") == 1234
stringToNumber("605" ) == 605
stringToNumber("1405") == 1405
stringToNumber("-7"  ) == -7
