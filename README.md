## first program invert values

Given a set of numbers, return the additive inverse of each. Each positive becomes negatives, and the negatives become positives.

invert([1,2,3,4,5]) == [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]
invert([1,-2,3,-4,5]) == [-1,2,-3,4,-5]
invert([]) == []
You can assume that all values are integers. Do not mutate the input array/list.

## second program highestlowest

The highest/lowest element is respectively only one element at each edge, even if there are more than one with the same value!)

Example:

{ 6, 2, 1, 8, 10 } => 16
{ 1, 1, 11, 2, 3 } => 6

If array is empty, null or None, or if only 1 Element exists, return 0.
Note:In C++ instead null an empty vector is used. In C there is no null. ;-) 


-- There's no null in Haskell, therefore Maybe [Int] is used. Nothing represents null.
Have fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-)

I have created other katas. Have a look if you like coding and challenges.

## third program string to number

Note: This kata is inspired by Convert a Number to a String!. Try that one too.

Description

We need a function that can transform a string into a number. What ways of achieving this do you know?

Note: Don't worry, all inputs will be strings, and every string is a perfectly valid representation of an integral number.

Examples

stringToNumber("1234") == 1234
stringToNumber("605" ) == 605
stringToNumber("1405") == 1405
stringToNumber("-7"  ) == -7

## fifth program function hello world!

Description:

Make a simple function called greet that returns the most-famous "hello world!".

Style Points

Sure, this is about as easy as it gets. But how clever can you be to create the most creative hello world you can think of? What is a "hello world" solution you would want to show your friends?

## sixth program count the monkeys

You take your son to the forest to see the monkeys. You know that there are a certain number there (n), but your son is too young to just appreciate the full number, he has to start counting them from 1.

As a good parent, you will sit and count with him. Given the number (n), populate an array with all numbers up to and including that number, but excluding zero.

For example:

monkeyCount(10) // --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
monkeyCount(1) // --> [1]

## SEVENTH PROGRAM GET THE MEAN OF AN ARRAY

Description:

It's the academic year's end, fateful moment of your school report. The averages must be calculated. All the students come to you and entreat you to calculate their average for them. Easy ! You just need to write a script.

Return the average of the given array rounded down to its nearest integer.

The array will never be empty.

## tenth program do i get a bonus

It's bonus time in the big city! The fatcats are rubbing their paws in anticipation... but who is going to make the most money?

Build a function that takes in two arguments (salary, bonus). Salary will be an integer, and bonus a boolean.

If bonus is true, the salary should be multiplied by 10. If bonus is false, the fatcat did not make enough money and must receive only his stated salary.

Return the total figure the individual will receive as a string prefixed with "£" (= "\u00A3", JS, Go, Java and Julia), "$" (C#, C++, Ruby, Clojure, Elixir, PHP, Python, Haskell and Lua) or "¥" (Rust).
